# Data Structures and Algorithms ‚Äì UC San Diego (Coursera)

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments from the **Data Structures and Algorithms** specialization by **University of California San Diego** on Coursera.

All solutions are written in **Python**, with each problem implemented in a single \`.py\` file.

---

## üìò Specialization Overview

The full specialization consists of six rigorous courses:

1. **Algorithmic Toolbox**
2. **Data Structures**
3. **Algorithms on Graphs**
4. **Algorithms on Strings**
5. **Advanced Algorithms and Complexity**
6. **Genome Assembly Programming Challenge**

---

## üìÅ Files Included

Each \`.py\` file corresponds to one programming assignment from the course.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

These programs read input from \`stdin\`. To run any solution:

```bash
python3 filename.py < input.txt
```

To enter input manually:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Then press \`Ctrl+D\` (Linux/macOS) or \`Ctrl+Z\` ‚Üí \`Enter\` (Windows) to finish input.
